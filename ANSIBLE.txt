ANSIBLE:
its a Configuration Management Tool.
Configuration: Hardware and Software 
Management: Pkgs update, installing, remove ----
Ansible is used to manage and work with multiple servers together.
its a free and Opensource.
it is used to automate the entire deployment process on multiple servers.
We install Python on Ansible.
we use a key-value format for the playbooks.

PLAYBOOK:
create servers
install packages & software
deploy apps
---------

Jenkins = pipeline = groovy
ansible = playbooks = yaml


HISTORY:
in 2012 dev called Maichel Dehaan who developed ansible.
After few years RedHat taken the ansible.
it is platform-independent & will work on all linux flavours.


ARCHITECTURE:
PLAYBOOK: its a file which consist of code
INVENTORY: its a file which consist ip of nodes
SSH: used to connect with nodes
Ansible is Agent less.
Means no need to install any software on worker nodes.

SETUP: 
CREATE 5 SERVERS [1=ANSIBLE, 2=DEV, 2=TEST]

EXECUTE THE BELOW COMMANDS ON ALL SERVERS:
sudo -i
hostnamectl set-hostname ansible/dev-1/dev-2/test-1/test-2
sudo -i

passwd root  -- > to login to other servers
vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config (38 & 61 uncomment both lines) 
systemctl restart sshd
systemctl status sshd
hostname -i

THE BELOW STEPS NEED TO BE RUN ON ANSIBLE SERVER:

amazon-linux-extras install ansible2 -y
yum install python3 python-pip python-dlevel -y

vim /etc/ansible/hosts
# Ex 1: Ungrouped hosts, specify before any group headers.
[dev]
172.31.20.40
172.31.21.25
[test]
172.31.31.77
172.31.22.114

ssh-keygen -- > enter 4 times 
ssh-copy-id root@private ip of dev-1 -- > yes -- > password -- > ssh private ip -- > ctrl d
ssh-copy-id root@private ip of dev-2 -- > yes -- > password -- > ssh private ip -- > ctrl d
ssh-copy-id root@private ip of test-1 -- > yes -- > password -- > ssh private ip -- > ctrl d
ssh-copy-id root@private ip of test-2 -- > yes -- > password -- > ssh private ip -- > ctrl d

ansible -m ping all : To check worker node connection with ansible server.

1. ADHOC COMMANDS:
these are simple Linux commands. 
these are used for temp works.
these commands will be over ridden.

ansible all -a "yum install git -y"
ansible all -a "yum install maven -y"
ansible all -a "mvn --version"
ansible all -a "touch file1"
ansible all -a "touch raham.txt"
ansible all -a "ls"
ansible all -a "yum install httpd -y"
ansible all -a "systemctl status httpd"
ansible all -a "systemctl start httpd"
ansible all -a "user add raham"
ansible all -a "cat /etc/passwd"
ansible all -a "yum remove git* maven* httpd* -y"


2. MODULES:
its a key-value pair.
modules are reusable.
we can use different modules for different purposes.
module flag is -m 

ansible all -m yum -a "name=git state=present"
ansible all -m yum -a "name=maven state=present"
ansible all -m yum -a "name=maven state=present"	[present=installed]
ansible all -m service -a "name=httpd state=started"	[started=restart]
ansible all -m service -a "name=httpd state=stopped"	[stopped=stop]
ansible all -m yum -a "name=http state=absent"		[absent=uninstall]
ansible all -m user -a "name=vikram state=present"
ansible all -m user -a "name=vikram state=absent"
ansible all -m copy -a "src=raham.txt dest=/tmp"

3. PLAYBOOKS:
playbooks used to execute multiple modules.
we can reuse the playbook multiple times.
in real time we use a playbook to automate our work.
for deployment, pkg installation, Server Creation ----
here we use key-value pairs.
Key-Value can also be called as Dictionary.
ansible-playbook will be written on YAML syntax.
YAML = YET ANOTHER MARKUP LANGUAGE
extension for playbook is .yml or .yaml
playbook start with --- and end with ... (opt)


EX-1:

- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: installing git
      yum: name=git state=present

    - name: installing httpd
      yum: name=httpd state=present

    - name: starting httpd
      service: name=httpd state=started

    - name: create user
      user: name=jayanth state=present

    - name: copy a file
      copy: src=index.html dest=/root

    

TO EXECUTE: ansible-playbook playbok.yml

Gather facts: it will get information of worker nodes
its by default task performed by ansible.

ok=total number of tasks
changed= no.of tasks successfully executed

EX-2:
 hosts: all
  ignore_errors: true
  tasks:
    - name: installing git
      yum: name=git state=absent

    - name: installing httpd
      yum: name=httpd state=absent

    - name: starting httpd
      service: name=httpd state=started

    - name: create users
      user: name=pushpa state=absent

    - name: copying a file
      copy: src=raham.txt dest=/root


TAGS: by default ansible will execute all tasks sequentially in a playbook.
we can use tags to execute a specific tasks or to skip a specific tasks.


EX-1:

- hosts: all
  ignore_errors: yes
  tasks:
    - name: installing git
      yum: name=git state=present
      tags: a

    - name: installing httpd
      yum: name=httpd state=present
      tags: b

    - name: starting httpd
      service: name=httpd state=started
      tags: c

    - name: create a user
      user: name=kohli state=present
      tags: d

    - name: copy a file
      copy: src=index.html dest=/tmp
      tags: e

SINGLE TAG: ansible-playbook raham.yml --tags d
MULTI TAGS: ansible-playbook raham.yml --tags b,c

EX-2:

- hosts: all
  ignore_errors: yes
  tasks:
    - name: uninstalling git
      yum: name=git* state=absent
      tags: a

    - name: uninstalling httpd
      yum: name=httpd state=absent
      tags: b

    - name: starting httpd
      service: name=httpd state=started
      tags: c

    - name: delete a user
      user: name=kohli state=absent
      tags: d

    - name: copy a file
      copy: src=index.html dest=/tmp
      tags: e

SKIP A SINGLE TASK: ansible-playbook raham.yml --skip-tags "c"
SKIP MULTIPLE TASK: ansible-playbook raham.yml --skip-tags "a,c"


==========================================================

HANDLERS:
when we have two tasks in a single playbook if task 2 is depending upon task 1 so then we can use the concept called handlers .
once task one is executed successfully it will notify task 2 to perform the operation. 
the name of the notify and the name of the task two must be same.


- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: installing httpd
      yum: name=httpd state=present
      notify: starting httpd
  handlers:
    - name: starting httpd
      service: name=httpd state=started

sed -i 's/present/absent/g' raham.yml

- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: installing httpd
      yum: name=httpd state=absent
      notify: starting httpd
  handlers:
    - name: starting httpd
      service: name=httpd state=started

SETUP MODULE: used to print the complete info of worker nodes
ansible all -m setup 

ansible all -m setup  | grep -i family
ansible all -m setup  | grep -i pkg
ansible all -m setup  | grep -i cpus
ansible all -m setup  | grep -i mem


CONDITIONS:
CLUSTER: Group of servers
HOMOGENIUS: all servers have having same OS and flavour.
HETROGENIUS: all servers have different OS and flavour.

used to execute this module when we have different Clusters.

RedHat=yum
Ubuntu=apt

- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: installing git on RedHat
      yum: name=git state=present
      when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat"

      shell: yum install maven -y

    - name: installing httpd
      command: yum install httpd -y

    - name: installing docker
      raw: yum install docker -y

raw >> command >> shell.

L	: LINUX
A	: APACHE
M	: MYSQL
P	: PYTHON

      yum: name=python3 state=present


 ansible all -a "httpd --version"
 ansible all -a "python3 --version"
 ansible all -a "mysql --version"


=============================================


SHORTCUTS FOR LINUX:
vim .bashrc
alias ar='ansible-playbook raham.yml'
alias info='ansible all -m setup'

source .bashrc

VARIABLES:

STATIC VARS: we can define these vars inside the playbook and use for multiple times, once a variable is defined here it will not change untill we change.


- hosts: all
  vars:
    a: maven
    b: httpd
  tasks:
    - name: installing maven
      yum: name={{a}} state=present
    - name: installing httpd
      yum: name={{b}} state=present

TO EXECUTE: ansible-playbook playbbok.yml

DYNAMIC VARS: therse vars will be defined outside the playbook and these will change as per our requirments.

- hosts: all
  vars:
  tasks:
    - name: installing maven
      yum: name={{a}} state=absent
    - name: installing httpd
      yum: name={{b}} state=absent


ansible-playbook raham.yml --extra-vars "a=docker b=httpd"


LOOPS: We can use loops to reduce the length of the code for the playbook

- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: installing pkg-1
      yum: name={{item}} state=present
      with_items:
        - git
        - java-1.8.0-openjdk
        - maven
        - docker
        - httpd


ansible all -a "git -v"
ansible all -a "java -v"
ansible all -a "maven -v"
ansible all -a "docker -v"
ansible all -a "httpd -v"


- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: installing pkg-1
      yum: name={{item}} state=absent
      with_items:
        - git
        - java-1.8.0-openjdk
        - maven
        - docker
        - httpd

ansible all -a "git -v"
ansible all -a "java -v"
ansible all -a "maven -v"
ansible all -a "docker -v"
ansible all -a "httpd -v"

EX-2:

- hosts: all

DEBUG: to print the messages from a playbook.

- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: printing a msg
      debug:
        msg: hai all welcome to my session

ansible all -m setup

NAME	: ansible_nodename
FAMILY  : ansible_os_family
PKG	: ansible_pkg_mgr
CPU	: ansible_processor_cores
MEM	: ansible_memtotal_mb

      debug:
        msg: "my node name is: {{ansible_nodename}}, the os is: {{ansible_os_family}}, the package manager is: {{ansible_pkg_mgr}}, total cpus is: {{ansible_processor_cores}}, the total ram: {{ansible_memtotal_mb}}, free ram is: {{ansible_memfree_mb}}"


JINJA2 TEMPLATE: used to get the customized op, here its a text file which can extract the variables and these values will change as per time.

LOOKUPS: this module used to get data from files, db and key values

- hosts: dev
  vars:
    a: "{{lookup('file', '/root/creds.txt') }}"
  tasks:
    - debug:
        msg: "hai my user name is {{a}}"

cat creds.txt
user=raham


STRATAGIES: Way of executing the playbook.

LINEAR: execute tasks sequentially 
if task-1 is executed on server-1 it will wait till task-2 execution
FREE: execute all tasks on all node at same time
if task-1 is executed on server-1 it wont wait till task-2 execution
ROLLING:

ROLES:
roles is a way of organizing playbooks in a structured format.
main purpose of roles is to encapsulate the data.
we can reuse the roles multiple times.
length of the playbook is decreased.
it contains on vars, templates, task -----
in real time we use roles for our daily activities.
yum install tree -y

mkdir playbooks
cd playbooks/

mkdir -p roles/pkgs/tasks
vim roles/pkgs/tasks/main.yml

ANSIBLE GALAXY:

Ansible Galaxy is a  website where users can share roles and to a command-line tool for installing, creating, and managing roles.
Ansible Galaxy gives greater visibility to one of Ansible's most exciting features, such as application installation or reusable roles for server configuration. 
Lots of people share roles in the Ansible Galaxy.
Ansible roles consist of many playbooks, which is a way to group multiple tasks into one container to do the automation in a very effective manner with clean, directory structures.

ANSIBLE VAULT:
Note: we can restrict the users to access the playbook also.
it is used to encrypt the files, playbooks ----
Technique: AES256 (USED BY FACEBOOK, AWS)
vault will store our data very safely and securely.
if we want to access any data which is in the vault we need to give a password.

cat creds.txt
user=raham
passowrd=test123

ansible-vault create creds1.txt		: to create a vault
ansible-vault edit creds1.txt		: to edit a vault
ansible-vault rekey creds1.txt		: to change password for a vault
ansible-vault decrypt creds1.txt	: to decrypt the content	
ansible-vault encrypt creds1.txt	: to encrypt the content	
ansible-vault view creds1.txt		: to show the content without decrypt

PIP: its a pkg manager used to install python libs/modules

Redhat: yum
ubuntu: apt
python: pip

- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: install pip
      yum: name=pip state=present

    - name: installing NumPy
      pip: name=NumPy state=present

    - name: installing Pandas
      pip: name=Pandas state=present

ASYNCHRONOUS & POLLING ACTIONS:
for every task in  ansible we can set time limit
if the task is not performed in that time limit ansible will stop playbook execution
this is called as asynchronous and polling.

- hosts: all
  ignore_errors: yes
  tasks:
    - name: sleeping
      command: sleep 30
      async: 20
      poll: 10
    - name: install git
      yum: name=git state=present


async: time we set for task to complete
poll: it will check if task is completed or not for every 10 sec
